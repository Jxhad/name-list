ARTHUR
--is it just me, or is it getting
crazier out there?
Despite the laughter, there's real pain in his eyes.
Something broken in him. Looks like he hasn't slept in days.
SOCIAL WORKER
It's certainly tense. People are
upset, they're struggling. Looking
for work. The garbage strike seems
like it's been going on forever.
These are tough times.
(then)
How 'bout you. Have you been
keeping up with your journal?
ARTHUR
Everyday.
SOCIAL WORKER
Great. Did you bring it with you?
Beat.
ARTHUR
(dodging the subject)
I'm sorry. Did I bring what?
SOCIAL WORKER
(impatient; she doesn't
have time for this)
Arthur, last time I asked you to
bring your journal with you. For
these appointments. Do you have it?
ARTHUR
Yes ma'am.
Beat.
SOCIAL WORKER
Can I see it?
He reluctantly reaches into the pocket of his jacket hanging
on the chair behind him. Pulls out a weathered notebook.
Slides it across to her--
ARTHUR
I've been using it as a journal,
but also a joke diary. Funny
thoughts or, or observations-- Did
I tell you I'm pursuing a career in
stand-up comedy?
She's half-listening as she flips through his journal.
SOCIAL WORKER
No. You didn't.
ARTHUR
I think I did.
She doesn't respond, keeps flipping through his journal--
PAGES AND PAGES OF NOTES, neat, angry-looking handwriting.
Also, cut out photos from hardcore pornographic magazines and
some crude handmade drawings.
A flash of anger crosses Arthur's face--
ARTHUR
I didn't realize you wanted to read
it.
The social worker gives him a look, then reads something in
the pages that gives her pause--
2.
SOCIAL WORKER
(reading out loud)
"I just hope my death makes more
cents than my life."
She looks up at Arthur. He just stares back. Lets it hang out
there for a beat.
Then he laughs a little, even though he doesn't think it's
funny--
ARTHUR
Yeah. I mean, that's just--
SOCIAL WORKER
Does my reading it upset you?
He leans in.
ARTHUR
No. I just,-- some of it's
personal. You know?
SOCIAL WORKER
I understand. I just want to make
sure you're keeping up with it.
She slides his journal back to him. He holds it in his lap.
SOCIAL WORKER
How does it feel to have to come
here? Does it help having someone
to talk to?
ARTHUR
I think I felt better when I was
locked up, in the hospital.
SOCIAL WORKER
And have you thought more about why
you were “locked up?"
ARTHUR
Well I suppose I was mentally ill.
SOCIAL WORKER
How’s that?
ARTHUR
Well my mother thought I was
mentally ill, so she had me
committed.
3.
SOCIAL WORKER
Did you feel mentally ill?
ARTHUR
They’ve been saying that since I
was little. So who knows.
Long pause.
ARTHUR
I was wondering if you could ask
the doctor to increase my
medication.
The social worker ruffles through some papers--
SOCIAL WORKER
Arthur, you’re on seven different
medications. Surely they must be
doing something.
Beat.
ARTHUR
I just don’t want to feel so bad
anymore.
And we HEAR "TEMPTATION RAG" playing on a broken down piano--
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE, MIDTOWN - AFTERNOON - DAYS LATER
CLOSE ON ARTHUR, NOW DRESSED UP AS A CLOWN, painted white
face... Wide red smile outlined in black around his mouth...
Bulbous red nose... Bald cap with two patches of frizzy green
hair sticking out over the ears, little bowler hat...
 Tootight buttoned jacket... Baggy pants and oversized colored
shoes. This is his job.
PULLING OUT, we see he's holding a sign in front of Kenny's
Music Shop that reads, "EVERYTHING MUST GO!" A banner above
the store reads, "GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!" Behind him, an OLD
MAN plays an old piano on the busy street, garbage bags piled
everywhere.
Arthur's doing a little Charlie Chaplin like performance to
the music, twirling the sign, bringing attention to the sale.
He's pretty good, feeling the music in his bones, light on
his feet. Still most people walk right past, ignoring him.
ARTHUR SEES A GROUP OF BOYS pointing at him from down the
street, laughing at him... One of the boys throws an empty
Coke can at Arthur as they get close... Arthur holds up the
sign like a shield, Coke can bouncing off it--
4.
The boys walk up on Arthur... He tries ignoring them, keeps
dancing to the old ragtime, holding up the sign as they
surround him... One of the kids knocks the sign out of
Arthur's hands--
The other kids crack up. Arthur bends over to pick up his
sign and... Kicks it... Attempts to pick it up again and...
Kicks it again... It's a bit.
Arthur bends over a third time to pick up the sign and...
One of the boys kicks him right in the ass--
Arthur falls face first onto the sidewalk. Oddly, the old man
playing the piano picks up the pace of the music--
The kids crack up. One of the boys grabs Arthur's sign and
takes off running across the street--
The other kids follow, weaving through traffic--
Arthur gets up and gives chase. He needs his sign back.
He almost gets hit by a taxi, spinning out of the way just in
time-- Spinning right into another taxi that stops just short
of hitting him.
Arthur keeps running through traffic. People stare. A clown
barreling down the street has got to be a joke--
EXT. CORNER, ALLEY - GOTHAM SQUARE - CONTINUOUS
The five boys are booking it down the busy street laughing
and whooping it up. At the last second they take a sharp
right turn down an alley--
Arthur almost overshoots the corner, slip-sliding in his
oversized shoes--
He rights himself and heads down after them--
Sees them running up ahead--
WHAP! Out of nowhere Arthur gets hit in the face!
He falls to the ground.
One of the kids was hiding behind a dumpster and hit Arthur
with the "EVERYTHING MUST GO!" sign, splintering it in two--
The other kids turn back and walk up to Arthur down on the
ground.
5.
Arthur reaches out, still trying to save the sign--
THE KIDS START KICKING AND BEATING THE SHIT out of Arthur.
It's brutal and vicious. Nobody on the street stops to help.
CLOSE ON ARTHUR'S CLOWN FACE, down on the ground. Sweat
running down his face, smearing his make-up. Doesn't even
look like he's in pain. He just takes the beating. Arthur's
good at taking a beating.
That stupid smile painted on his face.
TITLE:
JOKER
INT. CITY BUS (MOVING) - HEADING UPTOWN - LATE AFTERNOON
Arthur sitting in the back of a crowded bus, looking out the
window at the city passing him by... his make-up's washed
off, still see some white grease-paint smudged on the sides
of his face.
He feels somebody staring, turns to see a sad-eyed THREE-YEAR- 
OLD BOY, face puffy from crying, sitting on his knees looking
back at him. His mother's facing forward, but even from
behind you can tell she's angry.
Arthur doesn't know where to look, feeling self-conscious and
small. He gets back into "character" smiling like a clown and
covers his face with his hands-- Starts playing the peek-aboo game with him.
The boy stares back at him for a moment then giggles--
WOMAN ON BUS
(turns back to Arthur;
already annoyed)
Can you please stop bothering my
kid?
ARTHUR
I wasn't bothering him, I was--
